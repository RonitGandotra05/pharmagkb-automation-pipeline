Step 1: Initial Excel Processing
------------------------------
1. Input: Raw phenotype and genotype data
2. Output: Excel files in step1_phenotype_genotype_output/processed_files/
3. Each file is named with the sample ID (e.g., N1DL5740.xlsx)
4. Excel Structure:
   - Column C: Initial drug list
   - Column E: Will contain drugs with dosing changes
   - Column F: Will contain drugs with alternate recommendations

Step 2: PharmGKB Data Scraping
-----------------------------
Script: pharmgkb_scraper.py

1. Input: 
   - consolidated_sample_urls_JAPAN(in).csv containing sample IDs and URLs
   - Excel files from step1_phenotype_genotype_output/processed_files/

2. Process:
   - Reads URLs for each sample from the CSV file
   - Uses Selenium WebDriver to access PharmGKB website
   - Scrapes CPIC recommendations for each drug
   - Handles dynamic content loading and page navigation
   - Extracts relevant sections starting from "Learn more about CPIC"

3. Output:
   - Saves scraped content in step2_input/scraped_content/
   - Files named as: {sample_id}_processed_content_{timestamp}.txt
   - Contains drug recommendations and gene information

Step 3: Final Processing
----------------------
Script: step2_process_all_samples.py

1. Input:
   - Excel files from step1_phenotype_genotype_output/processed_files/
   - Scraped content from step2_input/scraped_content/
   - Drug Wise Aggregate Samples.xlsx for consolidated results

2. Process:
   For each sample:
   a) Reads the scraped content file
   b) Parses CPIC recommendations:
      - Identifies drug sections
      - Extracts "Dosing Info" and "Alternate Drug" recommendations
      - Captures gene information (e.g., CYP2C9 *1/*29)
   
   c) Processes Excel file:
      - Preserves cell styles and formatting
      - Moves drugs with dosing recommendations to Column E
      - Moves drugs with alternate recommendations to Column F
      - Keeps remaining drugs in Column C
   
   d) Updates aggregate file:
      - Adds new column for each sample
      - Records "Dosage Change" or "Consider Alternate" with gene info
      - Maintains "Standard Precautions" for unchanged drugs

3. Output:
   - Processed Excel files in step2_output/processed_files/
   - Updated Drug Wise Aggregate Samples.xlsx
   - Detailed logs in step2_output/logs/

Key Features:
-----------
1. Maintains data integrity:
   - Preserves Excel formatting and styles
   - Handles merged cells carefully
   - Maintains original drug case sensitivity

2. Error Handling:
   - Comprehensive logging at each step
   - Continues processing if one sample fails
   - Reports success/failure statistics

3. Data Validation:
   - Only processes samples with both Excel and content files
   - Verifies drug names and recommendations
   - Ensures gene information is correctly extracted

4. Formatting:
   - Maintains consistent output format
   - Preserves cell styles in Excel files
   - Standardizes recommendation text

Usage Notes:
-----------
1. Ensure all input files are in their correct locations
2. Run scripts in order: step1 → scraper → step2
3. Monitor logs for any processing issues
4. Check the aggregate file for consolidated results
5. Verify processed Excel files in step2_output/processed_files/
